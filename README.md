# ComputerGraphics_WebGL-three.js
Group assignments of Computer Graphics course, using WebGL and three.js

## Ex1 First Exploration in 2D World
Draw a 2D animal;

Use the keyboard to control the character forward, backward, and jump;

Implement the menu function.

## Ex2 First Exploration in 3D World
Draw a 3D animal;

Control the movement of the character in three-dimensional space with our control pad;

The character now can move based on either the screen coordinate system or its own coordinate system(e.g. move towards its head);

Movements consist of up, down, left, right, forward, backward, rotation;

Implement Virtual Trackball.

## Ex3 Roaming and Lighting
Implement roam in the 3D scene;

Lighting is added in our scene, with a control pad to change the properties of light sources;

## Ex4 Comprehensive Experiment
Applying texture mapping technology to add details of surfaces, making objects more real-like.
